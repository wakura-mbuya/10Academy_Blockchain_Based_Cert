## Introduction
Web 3 is a new era of the internet that is based on the blockchain technology.  Web 3 includes the concept of decentralized web apps and token-based economics. Some of the key features of web 3 technology include user-owned data, decentralized web application, digital money (crypto currencies), property rights, open source software, collective action and interoperability and collective action. The web 3 technology is attempting to solve the problems that arose during web 1 and web 2. This project presents an implementation of an end-to-end Web3 dApp that uses the Algorand blockchain technology. The web 3 dApp that is being implemented will help 10 Academy generate and distribute Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as certificates that will represent the successful completion of a weekly challenge to trainees, and allow trainees with NFTs to interact with a smart contract to perform pre-defined actions.  
## Project objective
The objective of this project is to develop a system that will enable 10 Academy team to distribute the certificates to trainees in a secure way. 
Currently,  certificates are distributed as simple PDF files, without the ability to verify their authenticity nor can 10 Academy undertake smart actions with the trainees/their contracts.

The final web 3 dApp will have the following sections:
* A Frontend implemented using Vue framework. The frontend will define the user interface for the dApp
* A backend implemented using Django framework. The backend retrieves data from the database and the Algorand network to be served in the frontend for the user to view it.
* Sandbox. Sandbox is the tool that will allow me to use Algorand blockchain within the dApp.
